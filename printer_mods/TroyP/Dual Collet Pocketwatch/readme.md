# Dual Collet Pocketwatch

### Issues with original design
The friction fit method of securing the bowden tube in the feed side of the pocketwatch caused many times for the tube to come out of the ectruder housing during a filament change. When this happens the back panel needs to be removed in order to put the bowden tube back in place so a print can be resumed.



### Solution
I modified the main body to accept the same push in collet as is on the other (output) side.
In order to avoid interfering with the latch, the inlet collet had to be angled slightly. The bowden tube gets inserted past this bend so it serves as a guide for the filament.
