# Simplified Z Drive Motor Mount

### Issues with original design
The friction fit method of securing the bowden tube in the feed side of the pocketwatch caused many times for the tube to come out of the ectruder housing during a filament change. When this happens the back panel needs to be removed in order to put the bowden tube back in place so a print can be resumed.

### Solution
I have simplified the design by combining the tensioner into the motor mount. Belt tensioning works by a small protrusion which pushes against the side of the Z drive housing (inspired by the original design). I have tried to keep the belt tension the same as is acheived in the original design. Assembly is surprisingly straightforward and cuts out a few of the steps required with a separate tensioning arm.

Combining the tensioner into the motor mount has created space for the extrusion slot key to be extended across the entire face of the motor mount, allowing for the key to work more effectively in aligning the motor mount squarely to the frame and ensuring that the motor pulley is aligned with the belt and 80T driven pulley.

The only downside I see is to the 'cool factor' The original design looked pretty awesome with the contrast of the tensioner handle, now it is a bit boring looking if I'm honest but it is very functional. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether its worth the change.
